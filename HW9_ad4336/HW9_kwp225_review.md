The title makes figure easy to read. But it is unclear what kind of geographical division is used, i.e. census tracts, zip codes, etc. 

The colors are easy to distinguish. As mentioned in the figure description, there are records of people living in the parks. I would exclude these areas and color them green. It would make easier to do further analysis. One can mention that around park there are blue areas. Perhaps people move out from park areas because of the cost increase. 

Excluding parks data will probably eliminate the extremities in distribution of percentage change graph. Then we could reduce the number of colors or even take a look at only increase and decrease in population.  

Also I find the legend confusing. The range of percent change is not the same for different groups. 

Visually left upper corner of figure area is empty. I would consider moving legend there and increasing the font size for easier reference.
