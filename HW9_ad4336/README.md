# HW9

# Assignment 1
In this assignment the review of classmates' plots is presented. I have reviewed works of Kent W Pan, [kwp225](https://github.com/kpan125/PUI2017_kwp225/blob/master/HW8_kwp225/README.md) and Fangshu Lin, [fl1210](https://github.com/fangshulin/PUI2017_fl1210/blob/master/HW8_fl1210/README.md). 
Since in the HW8 we were given freedom to explore dataset of our choice and deliver informative visualisations, it was interesting to explore what people have decided to concentrate on.
