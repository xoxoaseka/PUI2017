# HW9

# Assignment 1
In this assignment the review of classmates' plots is presented. I have reviewed works of Kent W Pan, [kwp225](https://github.com/kpan125/PUI2017_kwp225/blob/master/HW8_kwp225/README.md) and Fangshu Lin, [fl1210](https://github.com/fangshulin/PUI2017_fl1210/blob/master/HW8_fl1210/README.md). 
Since in the HW8 we were given freedom to explore dataset of our choice and deliver informative visualisations, it was interesting to explore what people have decided to concentrate on.
# Assignment 2
I have mostly worked alone. But this time 80% of the assignment was completed in the CUSP department. We have met with classmates on Sunday and the working atmosphere was very helpful. Alex helped me with API key, we ended up reading it from the txt file stored in the our PUIdata directory. Also we have compared our merged datasets to make sure that we are on track.
