#### The review comprises three parts:
   1. Clarity
   2. Aesthetics and selection of visual representation for information presentation
   3. Overall assessment (opinion)

## Clarity

Yelp enthusiast.. the data presented is cool, clear and relevant to the reader.

You've got at least three variables represented well:
1. Time
2. Location (city)
3. Score

The legend is clear, source on information relevant and explanations meaningful.

One small item you may want to improve is to increase the text size of the percentage listed next to the charts - they're a bit small. It all looks great otherwise.

**Nice job**



## Aesthetics and selection of visual representation for information presentation

In general, pie charts are a visualisation which should be approached with caution. However, you've done a really great job here, and the hollow / donut pie charts are the best type, if a pie can't be avoided (which sometimes they can't be). 

Choice of colors to contrast the star ratings seems reasonable with green representing 'good' and red representing 'bad'. You may need to hope none of your readers are color-blind though, as under the color-blind scenarios your colors turn out as varying shades of green or red/pink depending on type. You should update this. 

Also, you have lots of good stats reported here, and what we're interested in is how star rating have changed over time and/or differ between location. And specifically, we might only be interested in the ratings given a 5 or 1, or above/below 3, so you could consider simplifying the numbers reported to these specific figures. And a 100% stacked bar might also suit this well to compare across time, or between locations.


## Overall assessment (opinion)

Overall, very neat chart. Good representation of **effect size**, limited **chart junk**, and **data/ink** ratio providing good insight. 

You could limit repetitiveness of labels in the middle of the donuts by placing locations on the left, and times on top to save you writing Las Vegas, Vancouver, 2008 and 2016 all twice (write it once.. optimize data-to-ink).

You may also like to switch positions of the 5-star and 1-star (and 4-star and 2-star) sections of the donut. When people read donuts, they generally start at the 12 o'clock mark, and circle around clockwise (like reading a clock). People might prefer to see the 5-star rating at the 12 o'clock mark (as opposed to the 1-star rating there). This is a minor observation, maybe even just a personal preference - let me know what you think!  ;)

**Well done!**
